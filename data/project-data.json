        "title": "Self-Navigating Robot",
        "summary": "My current passion project involves the development of an autonomous robot designed to proficiently map and navigate environments independently, leveraging custom-designed QR codes as navigational waypoints. This innovative robot integrates advanced technologies including sonar sensors, a high-resolution camera, and a sophisticated four-wheel Mecanum drive system, all powered by the Raspberry Pi 4 platform. Over the past year, I have dedicated my spare time to meticulously crafting and refining this autonomous robot, with the ultimate goal of showcasing its capabilities to my esteemed colleagues within our organization. My aspiration is to not only highlight the intricacies of robotics engineering but also to inspire and encourage others to explore the fascinating realm of robotics, both as a professional pursuit and as a rewarding hobby.",
