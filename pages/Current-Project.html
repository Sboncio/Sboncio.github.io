                <p>
                    Over the christmas period, I am working with a partner
                    to create a robot that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">mecanum wheels</a> 
                    to traverse. I am using a Raspberry Pi to handle the logic, which can then be
                    implemented with various sensors.
                    These additional sensors will be used to support an autonomous navigation system
                    that can be activated if the user no longer wishes to manually control the robot.
                </p>

                    I have started researching which technologies I should use on this project. I have settled
                    on using ROS2, as this allows for me to easily add additional modules for more features.
                    The Logic of the system will be written in C++, and the interface with the motors and sensors will 
                    be written in python. This combination will allow for the best mixture of efficient control
                    and speed to project completion.

                    The robot chassis has now been put together and a motor controller has been purchased ready 
                    for installation on the Raspberry pi. Once delivered, wiring will be completed between 
                    the DC motors and the motor driver board.
                    Side note: googly eyes have been added to the chassis and has been named Greg.
